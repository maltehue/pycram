    "Did you notice, that for the joins we did not join the tables together in a typical sql kind of way, but rather used the relationships defined in the ORM classes and wrote joins like PickUpAction.object or Object.pose? This is because the ORM package automatically creates the joins for us, so we only have to join on the attributes that hold the relationship. This is a huge advantage over writing sql queries by hand, since we do not have to worry about the join conditions. \n",
    "This is a strong tool, but it is crucial to use it properly. Very important to note: The order of the joins matters! For instance, if we joined the Pose table with the Object table first, and placed the join between the PickUpAction table and the Object table second, sqlalchemy would have selected the Pose not from the join between all three tables, but rather from a join between the Pose and the Object table + from a join between the PickUpAction table and the Object table. These mistakes can lead to wrong results or even to errors (the above-mentioned example would actually lead to an error due to the Object table being accessed twice in two separate joins in the same query and therefore the column names of the Object tables would have been ambiguous and could not be used by sqlalchemy to join).\n",
