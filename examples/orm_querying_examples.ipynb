This query not only required more joins and the usage of the of_type() function, but we actually needed to access two of the tables twice with different purposes, namely the Pose and Position tables. We wanted to get the position of the robot relative to the object position, meaning we had to obtain all robot positions and all object positions. If we want to access the same table twice, we have to make sure to rename (one of) the occurrences in our query in order to provide proper sql syntax.
