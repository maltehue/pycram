    "# Plan Language\n",
    "The PyCRAM plan language is a way to structure the execuition of your plan. In generall the plan language allows to execute designators either sequential or in parallel. Furthermore, excpetions that occur during execution of a plan with the plan language do not interupt the execution instead they are catched and saved to a dictionary for later analysis. All language expressions return a State, this can either be SUCCEDED or FAILED.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 language expressions: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Expression | Name | Description| \n",
    "| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |\n",
    "| + | **Sequential** | Executes the designators one after another, if one of the designators raises an exception the execution is aborted and the state FAILED will be returned.  |\n",
    "| - | **Try In Order** | Executes the designators one after another, if one designator raises an exception the exception is catched and saved but the execution is not interrupted and the other designators are executed. Returns the state SUCCEDED if at least one designator can be executed without exception. |\n",
    "| * | **Repeat** | Repeat the previous language expression a number of time. Has to be used with a language expression and an integer. | \n",
    "| \\| | **Parallel** | Executes all designators in parallel. For each designator there will be a new thread created and the designator is executed in this thread. If one of the designators raises an exception the returned state will be FAILED. |\n",
    "| ^ | **Try All** | Executes all designators in parallel with a designated thread for each designator. Returns the state SUCCEDED if at least one designator can be executed without an exception|\n",
    "| >> | **Monitor** | Monitors the execution of the attached langauge expression, will interrupt the execution as soon as a given condition is fulfilled. | \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequential expression is the only one which aborts the execution once an error is raised. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using the plan language a tree structure of the plan is created where the language expressions are nodes and designators are leafs. This tree uses AnyTree (like the task tree) and can be rendered with the anytree Renderer.    "
